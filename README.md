- 👋 Hi, I’m @sunsetsherbet
- 👀 I’m interested in: learning so that I am able to creat complicated and advanced programs that I can use to either help me in my career building or just to challenge myself.
A big part of my interest in programming is that we can create almost any program with our brain power and knowledge of languages and that is what I intend to do while learning here and on codecademy.
I am more interested in becoming a great programmer that can create complex programs by myself than learning different languages to secure a job.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: nothing at the moment but I'm sure that I will have a project soon that I could use help with.
